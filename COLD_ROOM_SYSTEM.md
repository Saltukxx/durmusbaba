- **Examples**: "10m × 6m × 3m", "180 m³"
- **Validation**: Realistic dimensions (0.1-100m per side)

### Question 2: Storage Temperature
- **Supported**: +12°C, +5°C, 0°C, -5°C, -15°C, -18°C, -20°C, -25°C
- **Examples**: "-18°C", "-20", "minus 18 degrees"
- **Application guide**: Each temperature with use case examples

### Question 3: Product Type
- **Categories**: Meat, Fish, Dairy, Fruits, Vegetables, Frozen, Beverages, General
- **Impact**: Affects specific heat calculations
- **Examples**: "meat products", "fresh vegetables", "frozen foods"

### Question 4: Daily Product Load
- **Range**: 0 - 50,000 kg per day
- **Impact**: Affects cooling load calculations
- **Examples**: "500 kg daily", "2 tons", "no daily loading"

### Question 5: Product Entry Temperature
- **Range**: -30°C to +60°C
- **Common scenarios**: Room temperature (20-25°C), pre-cooled (5-10°C), already frozen (-18°C)
- **Impact**: Higher entry temperatures require more cooling capacity

### Question 6: Ambient Temperature
- **Range**: 20°C to 55°C
- **Regional examples**: Northern Europe (25-30°C), Southern Europe (35-40°C), Middle East (40-45°C)
- **Impact**: Higher ambient temperatures increase cooling requirements

### Question 7: Insulation Specification
- **Range**: 50-300mm thickness
- **Standard options**: 80mm (light duty), 100mm (standard), 120mm (heavy duty), 150mm (ultra-low temp)
- **Impact**: Thicker insulation reduces energy consumption

### Question 8: Door Usage Frequency
- **Categories**: Low (1-5), Medium (6-20), High (21-50), Very High (50+) times per day
- **OR specific number**: "15 times per day"
- **Impact**: More door openings significantly increase cooling load
